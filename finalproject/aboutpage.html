        <b>My Better Halva started as a neighborhood stand in my hometown in Virginia 
            where people from across town would stop by for cheesy pide, kofte, and
            limonata made by my mother and I. I decided to follow my dreams and pursue
            food studies at Virginia Tech shortly after. Within a year of graduating
            that little neighborhood stand turned into a pop-up in Richmond where I served
            dozens of customers per day. I received numerous awards during this time, such as 
            <i> Pop-Up of the Year. </i> in 2020. I made my transition into the restaurant scene right 
            before the pandemic and continue to run My Better Halva with my partner. Now housed near 
            Union Square, this family run restaurant strives to deliver high quality Turkish food to 
            anyone with a hunger for good food and a good time.
